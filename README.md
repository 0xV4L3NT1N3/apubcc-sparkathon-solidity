# APUBCC Sparkathon Solidity
Take a first baby mini step into Solidity by building a simplified ERC20 token, built with love for [APU BCC Sparkathon](https://apubcc-sparkathon.devfolio.co/).

### Using These Samples
1. Open up [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), a no install Ethereum development environment in your browser.
2. Copy the Solidity code samples. compile and then deploy the sample contracts.
3. Interact with the contract's functions under the Deployed Contracts tab.

### Demo Contracts
HelloWorld.sol - Everyone has to start somewhere ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ \
Token.sol - A simplified version of an [ERC20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), the building blocks to DeFi.

### It's Not Working

I might see Twitter messages better on [@0xV4L3NT1N3](https://twitter.com/0xV4L3NT1N3).
